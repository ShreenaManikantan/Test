     1.public is access specifier 
       static is a non-access specifier
       void is a return type
       main is method name
       (string []args) is parameter in side parenthesis.
 

     2.class is a templet which contains state and behavior.
       object is a instance of class
 


    3.jdk is java development kit which contains JRE and development tools
      JRE which provide run time environment which contains JVM and set of lib
      JVM is java virtual machine which performs 4 functions -provide run time environment ,read the  bytecode line by line, verifies the byte code, execute the byte code.


2.constractor is a special type of method which have same name as class name and does not have return type.
  Types are default constructor and parameterize constructor.

 
3.Diffrence between this key word and this()?
 keyword = It is a special word which have pre-defined meaning.
 this key word is used in order to remove ambiguity between instance variable and parameters and used to create object.


4.Why main method is static and explain types of method?
 because we can be create class with out object.


7.class Length{

public static void main(String args[]){

int num[] = {12,3,2,45,6,7,6};
System.out.println("main started");
for(num = 0;num<=num.length; num++)
 System.out.println(num.length);
System.out.Println("main ended");


   }

} 


8.can we use instance variable inside the static method?
yes 


9.polymorphism is an object which behaves differently at an instance of time.
example: 
class Engineer{
 
public void solveProblem(){
 system.out.println("the problems are solved by engineer");
}


class EcEngineer extends Engineer{
@Override
publiv void solveProblems(){
super.solveProblems();
system.out.println("the problems are solved by engineer); 
}
}

class EngineerRunner{

public static void main(String args[]){
 
Engineer ref = new EcEngineer();
ref.EcEngineer()  
}


10.inheritance is a process of priority which is given from one class to another  ie from parent class to child class.


example: 
class Hospital{
 
public void getPtient(){

}

class RvHospital extends Hospital{
 
}


class HospitalRunner{

public static void main(String args[]){

Hospital ref = new RvHospital();
ref.RvHospital(); 
}
